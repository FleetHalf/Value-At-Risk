# Value At Risk
 I calculate basic methods of measuring downside risk using python for five most traded Indian stocks
1. I used the yfinance API to get the stock data of Infosys, Tata Consultancy sevices, Tata Motors, ITC and Reliance.
2. Next, I made some changes to arrive at the monthly returns and finally, calculated the percentage change each month.
3. After that, I first created a wealth index to calculate the max drawdown and depicted that graphically
4. Finally, I calculated the value at risk using the three most common methods, and did a graphical comparison, showing how the different methods give us slighlty varying values.
